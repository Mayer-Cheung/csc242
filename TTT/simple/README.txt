I did not collaborate on this project and all work is my own.

platform:
	Windows 10, 64-bit, Dev-C++ 5.2.0.3
Language:
	C++
How to run:
	I'm using Dev-C++, and compile and excute it directly. If
	I have free time after the writeup, I will try to learn how
	to write a makefile. If you have some problem about how to run
	contact me: zzhang72@u.rochester.edu
