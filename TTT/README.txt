I did not collaborate on this project and all work is my own.

Files:
	README.txt  --This file, basic explaination
	simple(folder)  --First part of the project
	9board(folder)  --Second part of the project
	WRITEUP.pdf  --Write up
Extra:
	1. I hope to joining in the tournament, however, I am not using java
	nor Linux, so I don't know how to run it myself.

	2. I don't know output the winner means by standard error
	or standard output

	3. Since I never run the tounament program myself, so I don't know...
	if my program have enough time, you can adjust the difficulty(search depth)
	in clever.cpp, increase it can get better performance. But since different
	hardward have different speed, so I'm not quite sure.
